    Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes,
    lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute
    little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… This opera's as
    lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have
    your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

    Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. And so we
    say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too,
    hope one day to go. The toilet. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate
    intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business
    school!
